# BinG: Automatic Balancing in Games

Bing is a video game development framework that aims to balance the game's difficulty according to the current player's skill. 

This approach will be done in a way that the designer can freely determine which aspects of the game will change in accordance to the player, and under what circunstances.

BinG operates by using python, more specifically the kanren library, to translate the conditions and actions specified by the game designer as rules and facts through logical programming.
